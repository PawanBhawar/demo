You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

For example, if your niece is turning  years old, and the cake will have  candles of height , , , , she will be able to blow out  candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height  and there are  such candles.

Function Description

Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of candles she can blow out.

birthdayCakeCandles has the following parameter(s):

ar: an array of integers representing candle heights
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of candles on the cake.
The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes the height of candle .

Constraints

Output Format

Return the number of candles that can be blown out on a new line.

Sample Input 0

4
3 2 1 3
Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

We have one candle of height , one candle of height , and two candles of height . Your niece only blows out the tallest candles, meaning the candles where . Because there are  such candles, we print  on a new line.



solution:--
class Birthday
{
  int birthdaycakecandles(int a){
  int height[a],count=0,big;
     for(int i=0;i<a;i++)
     {
      int height[i]=sc.nextInt();     
     }
     big = height[0];
    for(int i=0;i<a;i++)
     {
     if(height[i]>height[0])
      {
        big = height[i];
      }
    int tall = big;
    if(tall==height[i])
    {
     count++;
    }
public static void main(String[] args){
  
  int age;
 Scanner sc = new Scanner(Systm.in);
 int age = sc.nextInt();
 int t = birthdaycakecandles(age);
 System.out.println(t);
 }
}

}


2.Consider a staircase of size :

   #
  ##
 ###
####
Observe that its base and height are both equal to , and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size .

Function Description

Complete the staircase function in the editor below. It should print a staircase as described above.

staircase has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer
Input Format

A single integer, , denoting the size of the staircase.

Constraints

 .

Output Format

Print a staircase of size  using # symbols and spaces.

Note: The last line must have  spaces in it.

Sample Input

6 
Sample Output

     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######
Explanation

The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of .

solution:-


class StairCase{
public static void main(String[] args){
   int n;
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
 for(int j=i;j<n-1;j++)
 {
 System.out.pritnln(" ");
 }
 for(int j=0;j<=i;j++)
 {
  System.out.println("#");
 }
 if(i<n-1)
 System.out.println("\n");
}
  
}
}
